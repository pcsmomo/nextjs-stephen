npm run dev
```

`page.tsx` is in controls the route

- src
  - app
    - performance
      - page.tsx
    - page.tsx

### 19. Adding a Create Page

#### Creating Records

1. Create a prisma client to access our database
2. Create a form in SnippetCreatePage
3. Define a Server Action. This is a function that will be called when the form is submitted
4. In the Server Action, validate the users input than create a new snippet
5. Redirect the user to the Home Page, which lists all the snippets

## Section 3: Streaming Content with React Server Components

### 24. Server Components vs Client Components

#### Server Components

- Default component in next js is basically server componente
- Can not use any kind of hook
- Can not assign any event handlers

#### Client Components

- Created by adding 'use client' at the very top of the file
- Have all the usual rules of components
- Can use hooks, event handlers, etc
- [Can not directly show a Server Component (there is one exception)](#36-server-actions-in-client-components)

### 25. Fetching Data with Server Components

Fethcing Data

1. Create a server component - a component that doesn't have 'use client' at the top
2. Mark the component as 'async'
3. Make an HTTP requests or directly access a database to get your data
4. Render your data directly, or pass it to a child component

### 28. Custom Not Found Pages

[Next js: File Conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions)

Special File Names in the 'app' Folder

| Name          | Purpose                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| page.tsx      | Displays the primary content for the page                                          |
| layout.tsx    | Wraps up the currently displayed page. Use to show content common aross many pages |
| not-found.tsx | Displayed when we call the 'notFound' function                                     |
| loading.tsx   | Displayed when a server component is fetching some data                            |
| error.tsx     | Displayed when an error occurs in a server component (must be client component)    |
| route.tsx     | Defineds API endpoints                                                             |

### 34. Adding the Monaco Editor

```sh
02-snippets % npm install @monaco-editor/react
```

## Section 4: Server Actions in Great Detail

### 36. Server Actions in Client Components

- Option #1. Define the Server Action in a **Server Component** and pass it as props to the Client Component
- ‚úÖ Option #2. Define the Server Action in a **separate file** and import it into the Client Component

### 38. Options for Calling Server Actions from Client Components

- Option #1. Use <form> action with `bind` function to customize the arguments

  ```js
  'use client';
  const editSnippetAction = actions.editSnippet.bind(null, code);
  return <form action={editSnippetAction}></form>;
  ```

  ```js
  'use server';
  export async function editSnippet(code: string, formData: FormData) {}
  ```

  - Form will work even if the user isn't running Javascript in their browser. (pointless in this case since our form requires JS for the monaco editor)
  - We will go with this Option #1 because many Next Js documents guide this approach

- Option #2. Not tied to a `form`
  ```js
  const handleClick = () => {
    React.startTransition(async () => {
      await actions.editSnippet(code);
    });
  };
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Submit</button>;
  ```
  ```js
  'use server';
  export async function editSnippet(code: string) {}
  ```
  - No messing around with `bind` function
  - Closer to classic React behavior
  - (Stephen seems to prefer this approach though)

## Section 5: Server Forms with the UseFormState Hook

### 41. Understanding the UseFormState Hook

Error Handling with Server Actions

- Remember, a big point of forms is taht they can work without JS in the browser
- Right now, forms in our pages are sending info to a server action
- We need to somehow communicate info from a server action back to a page
- `React-dom` (not react) contains a hook called `useFormState` specifically for this

#### useFormState can be used in only Client Component

### 44. Gotchas Around Error Handling

`error.tsx` must be a client component

## Section 6: Understanding Next's Caching System

### 45. Super Unexpected Behavior

```sh
02-snippets % npm run build
02-snippets % npm run start
```

Add a new snippet but after refreshing the new data doesn't appeal

### 46. The Full Route Cache System

#### Caching

Next implements caching in several locations. Can lead to unexpected behavior

- Data Cache: Responses from requests made with `fetch` are stored and used across requests.
- Router Cache: `Soft` navigation between routes are cached in the browser and reused when a user revisits a page.
- Request Memoization: Make two or more `GET` requests with `fetch` during a user's request to your server? Only one `GET` is actually executed.
- Full Route Cache: **At build time**, Next decides if your route is **static** or **dynamic**. If it is static, the page is rendered and the result is stored. In production, users are given this pre-rendered result.

### 47. What Makes a Static or Dynamic Route

```sh
02-snippets % npm run build
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
‚îå ‚óã /                                    175 B            94 kB
‚îú ‚óã /_not-found                          875 B            88 kB
‚îú ∆í /snippets/[id]                       175 B            94 kB
‚îú ∆í /snippets/[id]/edit                  4.69 kB        91.8 kB
‚îî ‚óã /snippets/new                        774 B          87.9 kB
+ First Load JS shared by all            87.1 kB
  ‚îú chunks/23-a783f3e56983d4ae.js        31.5 kB
  ‚îú chunks/fd9d1056-be48aeae6e94b8d1.js  53.7 kB
  ‚îî other shared chunks (total)          1.88 kB
```

Not just a pretty bullet list.

These indicate what Next thinks about your different routes.

- `‚óã`: Next thinks this route contains only static data. Next will render the page **NOW, ONE TIME** and give that version to everyone who visits your app
- `∆í`: Next thinks this route contains dynamic data. Next will render the page **whenever someone visits it**

#### What makes a page "dynamic"?

- Calling a `dynamic function` or referencing a `dynamic variable` when your route renders
  - `cookies.set()`
  - `cookies.delete()`
  - `useSearchParams()`
  - `searchParams prop`
- Assigning specific `route segment config` options
  - `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic`
  - `export const revalidate = 0`
- Calling `fetch` and opting out of caching of the response
  - `fetch('...', { next: { revalidate: 0 }})`
- Using a dynamic route
  - `/snippets/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `/snippets/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

### 48. When to Use Each Cache Control

There are several ways to control caching

- Time-Based: Every X seconds, ignore the cached response and fetch new data
  - `export const revalidate = 3; // every 3 seconds`
  - e.g: Front page of social media site
  - e.g: Data is changing all the time - only get the top posts every 10-30 seconds
- On-Demand: Forcibly purge a cached response
  - ```js
    import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
    revalidatePath(`/snippets`);
    ```
  - e.g: we know when data changes and the user expects to see up-to-date data
- Disable Caching: Don't do any caching at all
  - `export const revalidate = 0`
  - `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic`
  - e.g: we don't know when data changes or when we expect the data to be different with every request
  - And the user still expects to see up to date data

### 50. Enabling Caching with GenerateStaticParams

Even if `/snippets/[id]` is a dynamic page, we want to generate all detail pages on build time

### 51. Caching Dynamic Routes

after adding `GenerateStaticParams` we won't get affected by `await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));`

so the cached page will get displayed immediately.

However, if we change the code, we won't see the changed code as it only shows the static(=cached) page.

It will work fine after adding `` revalidatePath(`/snippets/${id}`); ``

> `npm run dev` doesn't use cache but it will be a little troublesome on the production with `npm run build` \
> because of complicated caching
> I should get used to Next js caching
